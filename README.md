**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
Ensuring the code works involves a lot of  testing at multiple levels. For this project, unit tests could be implemented for the Contact and ContactService classes, validating that individual methods perform as expected. Additionally, integration tests could be employed to check the interaction between different components. Regular code reviews with other people can uncover potential issues, and the use of version control systems, like Git.

To enhance security, input validation and exception handling were implemented in both projects to prevent wrong or malicious data from compromising the system. Regularly updating dependencies, following best practices in secure coding, and staying informed about security vulnerabilities are crucial steps to maintain a secure software environment.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Understanding user needs is fundamental to designing effective software. In this project, the user needs were addressed by creating a Contact class that contains essential contact information. The ContactService class was then developed to manage contacts based on common user requirements such as adding, deleting, and updating contacts. By incorporating methods like addContact and updateContact, the functionality aligns with typical user expectations.

User feedback, whether direct or through user testing, is invaluable. It helps identify areas for improvement or features that may not have been initially considered. In a real-world scenario, conducting user interviews, creating personas, and employing user stories can deepen the understanding of user needs, ensuring that the software aligns closely with user expectations.

**How do I approach designing software?**
The approach to designing software involves a systematic process, starting with understanding the problem domain and defining requirements. In these projects, the Contact and ContactService classes were designed to represent real-world entities and encapsulate related functionalities. Object-oriented principles, such as encapsulation and modularity, were followed to create maintainable and scalable code.

Iterative development and feedback loops are essential components of the design process. By continuously testing, refactoring, and incorporating feedback, the software design can evolve to better meet user needs and adapt to changing requirements.

In a broader context, considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and extensibility during the design phase contributes to creating good and adaptable software systems. Regularly revisiting and refining the design based on changing requirements or emerging challenges is crucial for long-term success.
